Creation has been a lifelong interest for me, whether with physical materials or with code. The inclusion of artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities in my processes of innovation will widen the scope of possibility in problems I could solve. I hope to learn more regarding the integrative potential for AI in engineering and compsci for application or automated system development and also hope to explore foresight and critical thinking ability expansion in machines.

Supervised learning and unsupervised learning both involve a supposed input X but differ in that supervised machine learning has an output variable Y for which an algorithm could be used to map a function from input to the output whereas unsupervised learning has no output variable. The lack of a "correct answer" so to speak means the goal is to model the structure or distribution of the data to in turn learn more about it. 

SKL does not have data visualization abilities and therefore to perform that function requires data analysis libraries such as Graphviz or Pandas.

Tensors are things implemented in TensorFlow as multidimensional data arrays. They're in the same family as normal mathematical vectors but they find themselves in vector spaces. The vectors can be represented in a coordinate plane in groups. A tensor is a way to represent a physical thing such as a vector with magnitude and direction in a representation that has many directions. 

I've noticed the elements in different arrays match to each other based on position so perhaps for something like multiplication this works similar to mathematical matrices where the number of columns and perhaps even rows must correlate.

One real world problem regards accessability in technological devices paired for individuals who are hard of hearing. These devices allow an individual to speak to someone else or hear things but often lose pieces of intended functionality in crowded, loud environments. To bypass these issues and have a working ASR or automatic speech recognition software system, we could use N-gram language models to build up neural language structures and then put those in speech recognition systems. Maybe pronunciation models could be looked at beforehand to put together the sounds for new char sequences. Maybe connectionist temporal classification for sounds from chars could be useful too.
