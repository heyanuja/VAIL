I think Machine Learning and AI concepts were utilized in game design because there's a machine learning model that's used to hire the people in the limited time frame with the task for automation. We further trained this model with the resumes of the people and that was like the data. Biased results were achieved but this is because we used biased data to begin with so that was another ML concept.

The famous COMPAS model was made to predict perpetrators recidivation chances but there were two times the amounts of false positives for the African American community than for the Caucasian community members. This wasn't a flaw with the data selection or anything but it was with the team not considering that the domain and questions to detect the recidivism were containing disaprities for COMPAS's algorithms. If they looked for bias they would have been able to find it so seeing that and removing it would be their first step to reduce the racial inequality there.
