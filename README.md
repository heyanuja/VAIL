# VAIL

2/8/21 | Day 1

Creation has been a lifelong interest for me, whether with physical materials or with code. The inclusion of artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities in my processes of innovation will widen the scope of possibility in problems I could solve. I hope to learn more regarding the integrative potential for AI in engineering and compsci for application or automated system development and also hope to explore foresight and critical thinking ability expansion in machines.
