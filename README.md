# VAIL

2/8/21 | Day 1

Creation has been a lifelong interest for me, whether with physical materials or with code. The inclusion of artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities in my processes of innovation will widen the scope of possibility in problems I could solve. I hope to learn more regarding the integrative potential for AI in engineering and compsci for application or automated system development and also hope to explore foresight and critical thinking ability expansion in machines.

Supervised learning and unsupervised learning both involve a supposed input X but differ in that supervised machine learning has an output variable Y for which an algorithm could be used to map a function from input to the output whereas unsupervised learning has no output variable. The lack of a "correct answer" so to speak means the goal is to model the structure or distribution of the data to in turn learn more about it. 

SKL does not have data visualization abilities and therefore to perform that function requires data analysis libraries such as Graphviz or Pandas.
