I think Machine Learning and AI concepts were utilized in game design because there's a machine learning model that's used to hire the people in the limited time frame with the task for automation. We further trained this model with the resumes of the people and that was like the data. Biased results were achieved but this is because we used biased data to begin with so that was another ML concept.

The famous COMPAS model was made to predict perpetrators recidivation chances but there were two times the amounts of false positives for the African American community than for the Caucasian community members. This wasn't a flaw with the data selection or anything but it was with the team not considering that the domain and questions to detect the recidivism were containing disaprities for COMPAS's algorithms. If they looked for bias they would have been able to find it so seeing that and removing it would be their first step to reduce the racial inequality there.

A convolutional neural network and a fully-connected neural network differ because a convolutional layer is a lot more specialized and efficient than a fully connected layer. for a FC layer, each neuron has a connection to every single other one in the prior later and this connection pattern is a general purpose and has no assumptions regarding data features. A convolutional layer however has each neuron connected to local neurons from the prior layer so instead of for everything, only a few cases can have this data be used without assumption although it can be used for cases where the data is or isn't interpreted as spatial. A typical use case is for image data because the features are local, as in the pixels which make up the image and thereby the different pieces of the image.
